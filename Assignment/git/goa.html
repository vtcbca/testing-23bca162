		<p>Goa (Konkani pronunciation: [ɡõːj], Portuguese: [ˈɡoɐ] ⓘ) is a state on the southwestern 
		   coast of India within the Konkan region, geographically separated from the Deccan highlands 
		   by the Western Ghats.[9][10] It is bound by the Indian states of Maharashtra to the north,
		   and Karnataka to the east and south, with the Arabian Sea in the west. It is India's smallest
		   state by area and fourth-smallest by population. Goa has the highest GDP per capita among all 
		   Indian states,[6][11] two and a half times as high as the GDP per capita of the
