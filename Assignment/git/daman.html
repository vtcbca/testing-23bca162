		<h1><center>DAMAN</center></h1>
		<p>Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu is a union territory in India.[4][5]
    	   The territory was constituted through the merger of the former territories of 
		   Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. Plans for the proposed merger were 
		   announced by the Government of India in July 2019; the necessary legislation 
		   was passed in the Parliament of India in December 2019 and came into effect on
		   26 January 2020.[6][7] The territory is made up of four separate geographical 
		   entities: Dadra, Nagar Haveli, Daman, and the island of Diu. All four areas were
		   formerly part of Portuguese India, with a joint capital at Panjim, Goa. They came 
		   under Indian rule in the mid-20th century after the Annexation of Goa and of the
		   Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Goa, Daman and Diu were jointly administered until 
		   1987, when Goa was granted statehood after the Konkani language agitation. The 
		   current capital is Daman and Silvassa is the largest city.</p>
